                <p>
                    Overburdened shelters take in millions of stray, abused and lost animals every year, and by adopting
                    an animal, you’re making room for others. Not only are you giving more animals a second chance, but
                    the cost of your adoption goes directly towards helping those shelters better care for the animals
                    they take in!

                    1.What type of animal is the best fit for your home? Will you be able to live with pet hair, a litter
                    box or the occasional wear-and-tear caused by pets?
                    2.How much space do you have inside and outside your home? Will you need a fenced yard? If you get a
                    cat, will you want an outdoor enclosure (a cattery) so your kitty can spend time safely outdoors?
                    3.How much time do you have to spend with a pet?
                    4.What is your activity level? Are you sedentary or physically active?
                    5.Do you have the financial resources if your pet has a medical crisis and has high veterinary bills?
                    6.Do you have someone who can be a secondary caregiver if you are away from home? If not, how will you
                    provide care for your pet when you travel?
